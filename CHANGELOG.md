# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Every push to `main` releases `v<VERSION.txt's version>` once every lane is green (`release.yml`),
with this file's `## [<version>]` section as the release notes, so before a merge raise
`VERSION.txt` and turn `## [Unreleased]` into that section. The notes of v1.4.2 and earlier are on
the GitHub releases themselves.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- 2026-10-16 — **A push runs Linux x64 and the gates; Linux arm64, Linux riscv64, Windows x64 and
  Windows arm64 run on request** (`on-request.yml`, the ci token in a commit message, or each
  lane's Run workflow button), the family's rule in [ANTfrastructure's
  `branch-and-release-strategy.md`](https://github.com/Kataglyphis/ANTfrastructure/blob/develop/docs/branch-and-release-strategy.md).
- 2026-10-16 — **Every push to `main` releases `v<version>`, and only when all five lanes are
  green** (`release.yml`). It carries the `.deb`, AppImage, flatpak (named per arch) and tarball of
  both Linux arches and the MSI, MSIX and zip of both Windows arches plus x64's installer, gathered
  by `scripts/linux/collect-release-assets.sh`; its suite runs with Linux x64 on every push. The
  Linux packages upload as `linux-packages-<arch>`, since one release run holds both arches.
  `gh workflow run release.yml --ref develop -f dry-run=true` runs it all on `develop` and
  publishes nothing.
